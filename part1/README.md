I Tim am responsible for part 1. There is a Makefile which I tested on the Virtual box which should compile/run part 1

I put all of the bitwise operations inside their own seperate methods for readability, and a method is added to create a mask ffrom n for getting the bits of n from the virtual address.

I make no use of m as we can assume there will be no errors on the input so instead of using m we can get the bits of m by removing all the bits of n
