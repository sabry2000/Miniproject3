Ahmed Sabry and Moataz abdelraouf were responsible for part 2. There is a Makefile which we tested on Virtual box which should compile/run part 2.

We split the methods that were assigned to us and any helper mthods that were created were written by the person responsible for implementing the specific method.  

We designed it such that the first KB of data is placed into its desired data structures, which is an array of bbytes, and an array of index nodes, 16 index nodes.
